        <h4>Crust</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup all purpose flour</li>
                <li>1/4 t salt</li>

            </ul>
        
        <h4> Filling</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>8 cups apples- peeled, cored, and sliced</li>
                <li>3/4 cup sugar</li>
                <li>1/4 cup all purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 t cinnamon</li>
                <li>1/4 t nutmeg</li>
            </ul>
        
        <h4>Topping</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup all purpose flour</li>
                <li>1/2 cup brown sugar</li>
                <li> 8 T cold butter</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>To make the crust: Place the flour and salt in a large bowl.</li>
                <li>Using two knives or a pastry cutter, work in the shortening until lumps the size of peas remain.</li>
                <li>The water should be ice cold and added gradually, mixing a little with a fork after each addition. Once you start to add the ice water, over-handling will make the crust tough, so try to keep handling to a minimum.</li>
                <li>When the dough starts to hold together a bit gather it with your hands and form it into a ball.</li>
                <li>Wrap and chill the dough for half an hour before rolling it out. While the dough is chilling, make the filling.</li>
                <li>To make the filling: Mix the apples with the flour, sugar and spices.</li>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 425°F.</li>
                <li>Transfer the dough to a floured board. Roll the dough until it's 2" larger in diameter than the top edge of the pie pan.</li>
                <li>Transfer the dough to the pan, and flute the edges. </li>
                <li>Pour them into the prepared pie pan. </li>
                <li>To make the topping: Cut the butter up with a knife a bit, then mix it into the flour and sugar with your hands or a fork until everything is mixed together but still a little lumpy. </li>
                <li>Spread this mixture evenly over the top of the apples.</li>
                <li>Place the pie on a baking sheet to catch any drips, and bake at 425°F for 15 minutes, then reduce heat to 350°F and bake for an additional 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Remove the pie from the oven and cool to lukewarm before slicing. </li>
                <li>Store, refrigerated, for up to 5 days. Freeze for up to 3 months.</li>
            </ol>
